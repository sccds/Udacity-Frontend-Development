I learned the concept of HTML and know how to crate tags on the webpage.
It is easy to create a tag.
But the tag attributes need to dig the documents and understand the usage.
When I meet the difficulties, just calm down, read/watch again the Udacity insturctions, find the clue, search the documents and find the answer. Then try it on my own webpage and verify the answer.
